        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Xander Cañedo Gonzalez! I have two last names because I am Mexican, 
    and in Mexico we carry on the Spanish tradition of having both paternal and maternal last names. 
    I was born in New Jersey, but I have roots in San Diego, California and the city of Guadalajara
    in Mexico. However, I've called Salt Lake City home for the past 25 years. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I love to travel, eat good food, make good drinks, and generally live life to the fullest. 
    I've been with my girlfriend, Elise, for about a year and a half. She's a native Utahn hailing
    from Utah County, however she's seen what Salt Lake has to offer and likely won't be going back 
    any time soon, despite the fact that we both work in Lehi.

    I work for a project management SaaS company doing white-glove tech support. I'm well versed in 
    consuming our own REST API (and I'm really exicted to be working on creating them further down the course!),
    as well as waterfall, agile, and kanban mangement methodologies. I work closely with our QA and Dev team because
    we need to collaborate so that we can deliver functionality our customers can rely on, as well as a 
    product that we can tout. I'm not too fond of it. And I can't wait to get out of it. My career path was 
    to move to QA Automation within my company but I recently did not get a position of Quality Engineer, so 
    I've decided to take this course to expand my skills. 
    </p>
